## Current Focus

Currently working on: Core implementation completed
Blocking issues: None
Next steps: Create unit tests to validate core functionality before adding caching layer

## User Direction (2025-08-27)

- IRequestRoutingDetector should ONLY expose IsRegistrationDriveCompatible method
- Everything else (GetVehicleRegistration, IsLegacyRegistrationFormat) are implementation details
- Cache implementation should be the LAST thing we work on
- Focus on getting core functionality working FIRST
- Then add caching as an optimization layer

## Important Context

### Key Technical Details

- Registration IDs can be either regular GUIDs (Drive) or encoded longs (Legacy)
- Use existing `TryParseLong` extension method to detect legacy format IDs
- Must check both RegistrationId match AND decoded legacy ID match
- Two-level caching: HTTP responses (5-10s) and routing decisions (20min)
- Drive is source of truth for all registration data
- `isDriveCompatible` flag determines routing in most cases

### User Feedback (2025-08-27 Session 2)

- Use existing utility functions: `TryParseLong` extension method already handles legacy ID detection
- Don't recreate logic that already exists in the codebase
- The `TryParseLong` method properly checks format and does conversion

### Implementation Approach

1. Create new service alongside existing LegacySystemDetector
2. Use feature flags to control rollout
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Gradually replace old implementation

## Session History

- Session 1 (2025-08-27):
  - Analyzed existing LegacySystemDetector implementation
  - Documented technical requirements and caching strategy
  - Updated project documentation with detailed specifications
  - Created IRequestRoutingDetector interface
  - Created IRegistrationCache interface with two-level caching design
  - Created IDistributedCacheProvider abstraction for cache backends
  - Documented design decisions and API contracts
  
- Session 2 (2025-08-27):
  - Implemented RequestRoutingDetector class without cache dependencies
  - Added direct API calls to GetVehicleRegistrationsByCustomer
  - Implemented GUID/Long conversion logic for legacy ID detection
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Registered service in dependency injection container (Program.cs)
  - Core functionality complete and ready for testing

## NEXT TASK Selection Rationale

**Selected: Create unit tests for core functionality**

Reasoning:

- Core implementation is complete but needs validation
- Must ensure all edge cases work correctly BEFORE adding cache complexity
- Unit tests will prove the registration lookup logic works correctly
- Tests will validate GUID/long conversion handles all scenarios
- Need to verify error handling returns null appropriately

This task involves:

1. Setting up test infrastructure for RequestRoutingDetector
2. Testing normal GUID registration lookups
3. Testing legacy format GUID to long conversion scenarios
4. Testing registration not found cases (returns null)
5. Testing error handling scenarios
6. Validating IsDriveCompatible flag is correctly returned

**Implementation Order (per user direction):**
1. Core logic implementation (current focus)
2. Unit tests to validate core logic
3. Only then add caching as optimization

**Key Points:**
- GetVehicleRegistration and IsLegacyRegistrationFormat are INTERNAL implementation details
- Only IsRegistrationDriveCompatible is the public API
- No cache in initial implementation - direct API calls only
