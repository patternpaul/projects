## Current Focus

Currently working on: Design completed, interfaces created
Blocking issues: None
Next steps: Implement RequestRoutingDetector class with core routing logic

## Important Context

### Key Technical Details

- Registration IDs can be either regular GUIDs (Drive) or encoded longs (Legacy)
- Must check both RegistrationId match AND decoded legacy ID match
- Two-level caching: HTTP responses (5-10s) and routing decisions (20min)
- Drive is source of truth for all registration data
- `isDriveCompatible` flag determines routing in most cases

### Implementation Approach

1. Create new service alongside existing LegacySystemDetector
2. Use feature flags to control rollout
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Gradually replace old implementation

## Session History

- Session 1 (2025-08-27):
  - Analyzed existing LegacySystemDetector implementation
  - Documented technical requirements and caching strategy
  - Updated project documentation with detailed specifications
  - Created IRequestRoutingDetector interface
  - Created IRegistrationCache interface with two-level caching design
  - Created IDistributedCacheProvider abstraction for cache backends
  - Documented design decisions and API contracts

## NEXT TASK Selection Rationale

**Selected: Implement core routing logic**

Reasoning:

- Design phase is complete with all interfaces created
- Core implementation is needed before caching layers can be added
- This provides the main functionality that everything else depends on
- Will allow testing of the routing logic before adding complexity

This task involves:

1. Creating the RequestRoutingDetector class
2. Implementing the registration lookup with both ID types
3. Adding proper GUID/Long conversion handling
4. Implementing error handling and logging

**Why this task next:**
- Interfaces are defined, now need concrete implementation
- Core logic must work before adding caching optimizations
- This delivers immediate value for testing the approach
- Establishes the pattern for handling both Drive and Legacy IDs
