## Current Focus

Currently working on: Analyzing requirements and designing architecture
Blocking issues: None
Next steps: Design and implement new RequestRoutingDetector interface

## Important Context

### Key Technical Details

- Registration IDs can be either regular GUIDs (Drive) or encoded longs (Legacy)
- Must check both RegistrationId match AND decoded legacy ID match
- Two-level caching: HTTP responses (5-10s) and routing decisions (20min)
- Drive is source of truth for all registration data
- `isDriveCompatible` flag determines routing in most cases

### Implementation Approach

1. Create new service alongside existing LegacySystemDetector
2. Use feature flags to control rollout
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Gradually replace old implementation

## Session History

- Session 1 (2025-08-27):
  - Analyzed existing LegacySystemDetector implementation
  - Documented technical requirements and caching strategy
  - Updated project documentation with detailed specifications

## NEXT TASK Selection Rationale

**Selected: Design new RequestRoutingDetector**

Reasoning:

- Foundation task that unblocks all other implementation work
- Defines the contract that other components will depend on
- Allows us to establish clean architecture from the start
- Critical for ensuring proper abstraction and testability

This task involves:

1. Creating the IRequestRoutingDetector interface
2. Defining cache abstraction interfaces
3. Planning the dependency injection setup
4. Documenting the API contract
