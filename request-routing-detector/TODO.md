## Current Focus

Currently working on: Simplifying interface per user feedback
Blocking issues: None
Next steps: Implement RequestRoutingDetector class WITHOUT CACHE - get core functionality working first

## User Direction (2025-08-27)

- IRequestRoutingDetector should ONLY expose IsRegistrationDriveCompatible method
- Everything else (GetVehicleRegistration, IsLegacyRegistrationFormat) are implementation details
- Cache implementation should be the LAST thing we work on
- Focus on getting core functionality working FIRST
- Then add caching as an optimization layer

## Important Context

### Key Technical Details

- Registration IDs can be either regular GUIDs (Drive) or encoded longs (Legacy)
- Must check both RegistrationId match AND decoded legacy ID match
- Two-level caching: HTTP responses (5-10s) and routing decisions (20min)
- Drive is source of truth for all registration data
- `isDriveCompatible` flag determines routing in most cases

### Implementation Approach

1. Create new service alongside existing LegacySystemDetector
2. Use feature flags to control rollout
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Gradually replace old implementation

## Session History

- Session 1 (2025-08-27):
  - Analyzed existing LegacySystemDetector implementation
  - Documented technical requirements and caching strategy
  - Updated project documentation with detailed specifications
  - Created IRequestRoutingDetector interface
  - Created IRegistrationCache interface with two-level caching design
  - Created IDistributedCacheProvider abstraction for cache backends
  - Documented design decisions and API contracts

## NEXT TASK Selection Rationale

**Selected: Implement core routing logic WITHOUT CACHE**

Reasoning:

- User explicitly wants core functionality working FIRST
- Cache is an optimization that comes AFTER proving the logic works
- Simpler to debug and test without cache complexity
- Can validate the approach before adding layers

This task involves:

1. Creating the RequestRoutingDetector class (no cache dependencies)
2. Direct API calls to get registration data
3. Implementing the registration lookup with both ID types
4. Adding proper GUID/Long conversion handling
5. Implementing error handling and logging
6. Testing that it correctly returns isDriveCompatible flag

**Implementation Order (per user direction):**
1. Core logic implementation (current focus)
2. Unit tests to validate core logic
3. Only then add caching as optimization

**Key Points:**
- GetVehicleRegistration and IsLegacyRegistrationFormat are INTERNAL implementation details
- Only IsRegistrationDriveCompatible is the public API
- No cache in initial implementation - direct API calls only
